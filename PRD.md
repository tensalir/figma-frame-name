# Product Requirements Document: Asset Name Plugin for Figma

## Overview
The Asset Name Plugin automatically adds the filename of imported assets underneath them in Figma, helping designers match their designs with the corresponding files in their folders.

## Problem Statement
When importing multiple assets into Figma, it can be difficult to track which design element corresponds to which file in the original source folders. This leads to inefficiency when updating designs or communicating about specific assets.

## Solution
Create a Figma plugin that:
1. Detects when assets are imported
2. Extracts the filename from the imported asset
3. Creates a text label with the filename
4. Positions the label directly beneath the imported asset

## User Flow
1. Designer installs the plugin
2. Designer imports assets into Figma (images, icons, etc.)
3. Plugin automatically detects the import and adds filename labels
4. Designer can optionally customize label style or disable the plugin

## Features
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects when assets are imported
